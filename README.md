# How to create Free Lets Encrypt Certificates and be ranked as A+

To generate the certificates I used Linux as operative system, Centos 7.2 to be precise. I also have installed the following software:

[root@ulisys ulisys]# httpd -version
Server version: Apache/2.4.18 (Unix)
Server built:   Feb 16 2016 23:49:27
[root@ulisys ulisys]# openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.2f  28 Jan 2016
